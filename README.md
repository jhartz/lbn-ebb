LBN Electronic Bulletin Board
-----------------------------

Files you need to add yourself:

- `custom/logo.png` - your logo (shown in corner of presentation); should be about 200x200 or thereabouts
- `custom/title.png` - a title slide; should be about 720x540
- `custom/weather-images/{clear.jpg,cloudy.jpg,foggy.jpg,icy.jpg,mcloudy.jpg,ptcloudy.jpg,rainy.jpg,snow.jpg,thunder.jpg,wintmix.jpg}` - backgrounds for the "Current Conditions" slide (changes automatically based on current conditions)
- `custom/LBN EBB Optionifier.zip` - a compiled version of the LBN EBB Optionifier (if you choose to use it); this is linked to in ebb.html; see [github.com/jhartz/lbn-ebb-optionifier](https://github.com/jhartz/lbn-ebb-optionifier)

Additionally, you need to adjust `plugins/weather.js` to match your location.
