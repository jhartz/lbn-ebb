TODO
----

- In "control" view (in ebb.html), make checkbox to enable/disable slide; if it's disabled we just skip over it while the slideshow is playing
- Also have another checkbox to enable "auto disable" of the slide, and at the top set a time to make all the "auto disable" slides disabled (ie. 5:00 am)
